RegTest and PlotEx
Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>

This repository contains two different Python tools. They're jammed
together in one repo because I'm lazy.

- RegTest: a simple IF regression tester
- PlotEx: a tool for exploring puzzle plot constraints

Both scripts are in the public domain. Or CC0 1.0 Universal, if you like.
